# ‚úàÔ∏è Takeoff ‚Äî Flight Price Prediction for Eurowings Digital

**üèÜ Awarded Best Project @ Le Wagon Data Science**  
**üöÄ Deployed on Google Cloud Run | FastAPI Backend | Streamlit Frontend**

Takeoff is a flight price prediction system built for **Eurowings Digital** (‚Ç¨2B airline group) to forecast competitor pricing strategies.  
The solution combines **machine learning**, **automated ETL pipelines**, and **cloud deployment** to deliver real-time price predictions via a web application.

It empowers airlines to proactively monitor market dynamics and adjust pricing strategies with data-driven insights.

## üìö Project Overview

- **Goal:** Help Eurowings Digital anticipate competitor pricing trends to optimize strategic decision-making.
- **Data:** Aggregated flight booking data sourced from Skyscanner and other providers.
- **Model:** Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost), trained on engineered features including:
  - Distance between airports
  - Destination GDP per capita
  - Cabin class
  - Flight type (Return / One-way)
  - Connecting vs. direct flights
  - Booking horizon and trip length
  - Carrier-specific behavior

## üõ† Tech Stack

| Component        | Technology            |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Modeling**     | XGBoost, Random Forest, Scikit-learn |
| **API**          | FastAPI |
| **Deployment**   | Docker + Google Cloud Run |
| **Frontend**     | Streamlit |
| **Data Handling**| Pandas, Numpy |
| **Environment**  | Python 3.11 |

<br>

## üõ§Ô∏è Architecture

- **Backend (FastAPI):**  
  Exposes a `/predict` endpoint which receives flight search parameters and returns a predicted flight price.

- **Model Training:**  
  `train.py` processes the historical flight data, engineers features, trains the model, and exports it as `pipeline2.pkl`.

- **Preprocessing Pipeline:**  
  `utils.py` and `model_pre_processing.py` handle dynamic feature engineering including:
  - Geographical distance computation
  - GDP enrichment
  - Categorical encoding and feature filtering

- **Deployment:**  
  - Dockerized using the provided `Dockerfile`.
  - Built and pushed to Google Artifact Registry.
  - Deployed with Google Cloud Run for serverless scalability.

- **Frontend (Streamlit):**  
  User-facing interface to select flight parameters and visualize predicted prices.

# Takeoff: Flight Price Predictor AI with Eurowings

Partnered with Eurowings Digital, this project aims to predict flight prices based on several parameters. Among the tools used are: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, streamlit, Docker, and more. The output is the **<u>predicted flight price</u>** depending on the following parameters:

- Origin Airport
- Destination Airport
- Cabin Class
- Trip Type
- Direct Flight
- Trip Length
- Flight Date
- Booking Date
- Airline

Important to note that one of the most important parameters for airlines is booking date, in other words, when a client books a flight in relation to the actual flight date. Therefore, think of this tool as almost a time traveller.
